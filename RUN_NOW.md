# ✅ Node.js is Working! Run These Commands:

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
In your PowerShell window, run:
```powershell
npm install
```
**This will take 2-5 minutes** - be patient, it's downloading all the packages.

## Step 2: Start the App
Once installation finishes, run:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Open in Browser
You'll see output like:
```
  ▲ Next.js 16.0.7
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

**Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000**

- Click "Login" and use demo accounts

## 🆘 If npm install is slow:
- It's normal - first time takes a few minutes
- Don't cancel it
- Wait for it to finish

## 🆘 If you see errors:
- Make sure you're in the project folder: `C:\Users\ABPS\Downloads\healthcare-app`
- Try running the commands one at a time
- If it fails, share the error message

**Just run `npm install` then `npm run dev` - you're almost there!** 🚀
