# ✅ Server Should Be Running!

## What I Did
I opened a **new PowerShell window** that is running `npm run dev` in the background.

## 🌐 Open Your Browser

**Go to:** http://localhost:3000

You should see your Healthcare App!

## 📋 What You Should See

- Home page with "Healthcare Management Made Simple"
- Login and Sign Up buttons  
- Demo buttons for Patient, Doctor, and Pharmacy dashboards

## 🔍 If It's Not Working

1. **Check the new PowerShell window** that opened - it should show:
   ```
   ▲ Next.js 16.0.7
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Wait 20-30 seconds** - First startup takes time

3. **Look for errors** in the PowerShell window

4. **Try a different port** - If 3000 is busy, it might use 3001, 3002, etc.
   - Check the PowerShell output for the actual URL

## 🎯 Test Accounts

- **Doctor**: `doctor@demo.com` / `demo123`
- **Patient**: `patient@demo.com` / `demo123`  
- **Pharmacy**: `pharmacy@demo.com` / `demo123`
